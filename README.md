# Image Retrievel

### Introduction

This is the image retrievel project. The aims is finding the similiar image of the input image from a given dataset (corel 1000). It is not allowed to add any feature or information manually. Therefore, the supervised learning technique is not available for this project.



We have tried many different combination feature comparison:

- pixel

- splited image and the cooresponding histrogram

- histrogram (rgb/hsv)

- PSNR

- MSSIM

- equalized greyscale

- SURF / SIFT / ORB

- Canny

- GLCM

- LBP
